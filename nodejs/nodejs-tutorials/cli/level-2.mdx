# Node.js CLI 2

<Levels />

Node.js provides built-in modules like `process` and `readline` to handle command-line arguments and user input. You can also use third-party packages like `commander` or `yargs` to create more complex CLI applications.

### Example using `process.argv`:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const name = process.argv[2] || "World";
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
```

Run this with `node greet.js Alice` to see "Hello, Alice!".
