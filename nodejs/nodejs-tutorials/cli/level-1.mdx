# Node.js CLI 1

<Levels />


CLI comes from Command Line Interface. Each programming language has its own way of creating CLI applications. Node.js is no different. Node.js comes with a variety of CLI options. These options expose built-in debugging, multiple ways to execute scripts, and other helpful runtime options.

## Examples

### Run a script

```sh
node index.js
```

### Run a script with a flag

```sh
node index.js --stack-trace-limit=12
```

### Run a script with watch mode
```sh
node --watch index.js
```
