## Assignment

There are a few primary ways to assign values to names in JavaScript - using variables or constants. On Exercism, variables are always written in camelCase; constants are written in [SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case). There is no official guide to follow, and various companies and organizations have various style guides. Feel free to write variables any way you like. The upside from writing them the way the exercises are prepared is that they'll be highlighted differently in the web interface and most IDEs.

Variables in JavaScript can be defined using the const, let or var keyword.

A variable can reference different values over its lifetime when using let or var. For example, myFirstVariable can be defined and redefined many times using the assignment operator =:

```js
let myFirstVariable = 1;
myFirstVariable = "Some string";
myFirstVariable = new SomeComplexClass();
```
